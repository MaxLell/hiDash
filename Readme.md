# Description
The purpose of this exercise project is to get familiar with TDD in javascript. In this project 2 functions, which are already present in the Lo-Dash library, are implemented using TDD. The functions are:
- `_.forEach()`
- `_.map()`

First the functions are implemented in the `index.js` file and then the manual test code is implemented in the `index.test.js` file. 
1. The tests are built in a manual way (this is not recommended for a production or serious setting). I only did this to get familiar with the TDD process, without the having the fuzz of setting up a test framework.
2. I refactored the test code into a test function
3. I replaced the if statements with asserts
4. I replaced the existing test code, so that it can be executed in the mocha testing framework

All the changes as they are listed from 1-4 can be found in the git history.
