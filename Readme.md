The purpose of this exercise project is to get familiar with TDD in javascript. In this project 2 functions, which are already present in the Lo-Dash library, are implemented using TDD. The functions are:
- `_.forEach()`
- `_.map()`

First the functions are implemented in the `index.js` file and then the manual test code is implemented in the `index.test.js` file. The tests are built in a manual way (this is not recommended for a production or serious setting). I only did this to get familiar with the TDD process, without the having the fuzz of setting up a test framework.
