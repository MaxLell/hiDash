The purpose of this exercise project is to get familiar with TDD in javascript. In this project 2 functions, which are already present in the Lo-Dash library, are implemented using TDD. The functions are:
- `_.forEach()`
- `_.map()`

First the functions are implemented and later the test code is written in a seperate file.
